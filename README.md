# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is part of the **FeatureForge: Crafting The Project Blueprint** initiative, designed to simulate a real-world software development environment through comprehensive **Requirement Analysis**.

The goal of this repository is to document, analyze, and structure the requirements for a **Booking Management System**. By following best practices in software engineering, this project emphasizes the critical role of requirement analysis in ensuring project success.

Throughout this project, you'll find structured documentation including:
- Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- Use Case Diagrams
- System Actors and Interactions
- Acceptance Criteria
- Visual Representations using tools like Draw.io

This blueprint serves as the foundation for building scalable and maintainable software systems, following industry-standard methodologies and tools.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system.

The primary goal of requirement analysis is to ensure that the development team fully understands what the software should do and the constraints under which it must operate. This process lays the foundation for the system design, development, testing, and deployment phases, making it essential for building successful and user-aligned software products.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

- **Clarity of Scope:** Clearly defines what the system should achieve, helping to avoid scope creep and misaligned objectives.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensures that all stakeholders (clients, users, developers, and testers) have a shared understanding of the system’s functionalities and limitations.
- **Risk Reduction:** Identifies potential risks, ambiguities, and conflicts early in the process, reducing costly changes during later stages.
- **Quality Assurance:** Acts as a benchmark for validation and verification, making it easier to measure the success of the final product.
- **Cost and Time Efficiency:** Helps in estimating project timelines and budgets more accurately by understanding the exact requirements.
- **Foundation for Design:** Provides the basis for system design, architecture, and interface decisions.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Elicitation:** Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, or existing documentation.
2. **Requirement Specification:** Clearly documenting the gathered requirements in a structured and understandable format.
3. **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and feasible.
4. **Requirement Management:** Continuously tracking and managing changes to the requirements as the project evolves.

By conducting thorough and well-documented requirement analysis, teams can ensure that the final product meets user expectations, complies with business rules, and is technically feasible and scalable.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most vital steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the end product aligns with user expectations and business goals. Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in software development:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Misalignment

Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between stakeholders and developers. By capturing the exact needs of users and translating them into actionable items, it ensures that everyone involved in the project is on the same page. This reduces misunderstandings and prevents development based on incorrect assumptions.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost

Identifying and resolving issues early in the project is significantly less expensive than making corrections during or after development. A well-executed requirement analysis helps avoid unnecessary rework, project delays, and budget overruns by laying a clear foundation before coding begins.

### 3. Ensures Product Quality and User Satisfaction

By focusing on what the users actually need and validating those needs throughout the process, requirement analysis helps produce a system that functions as expected. This increases the likelihood of user satisfaction and ensures the product is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.

By addressing potential risks, setting clear expectations, and ensuring that the solution is aligned with business objectives, **Requirement Analysis** acts as a cornerstone for the success of any software project.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential to building a complete and reliable system. Below is a breakdown of each type in the context of a **Booking Management System**.

### Functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements** describe what the system should do — the specific behaviors, functions, and features that must be implemented.

These requirements are directly tied to the core operations of the system and outline how it interacts with users, external systems, or internal processes.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- Users must be able to **create an account** using their email and password.
- The system must allow users to **search for available rooms** based on dates, location, and type.
- Registered users should be able to **make a booking** for selected dates and properties.
- The admin should be able to **add, edit, or delete** room listings.
- Users must receive **email confirmation** upon successful booking.
- The system must allow **cancellation or modification** of bookings based on policy.

### Non-functional Requirements

**Non-functional Requirements** describe how the system should behave. They define quality attributes, constraints, and performance benchmarks that the system must meet, but do not directly relate to specific functionalities.

These requirements ensure the system is usable, efficient, and maintainable.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- The system must respond to search queries within **2 seconds** (Performance).
- User data must be stored securely and **encrypted at rest** (Security).
- The platform should be **available 99.9%** of the time annually (Availability).
- The UI should be **responsive** and work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (Usability).
- The system should be able to handle **up to 10,000 concurrent users** during peak times (Scalability).
- Booking records should be stored for **at least 5 years** for auditing purposes (Data Retention).

Understanding and documenting both types of requirements ensures that the system not only works as expected but also performs reliably and securely in real-world conditions.
