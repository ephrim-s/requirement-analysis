# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is part of the **FeatureForge: Crafting The Project Blueprint** initiative, designed to simulate a real-world software development environment through comprehensive **Requirement Analysis**.

The goal of this repository is to document, analyze, and structure the requirements for a **Booking Management System**. By following best practices in software engineering, this project emphasizes the critical role of requirement analysis in ensuring project success.

Throughout this project, you'll find structured documentation including:
- Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- Use Case Diagrams
- System Actors and Interactions
- Acceptance Criteria
- Visual Representations using tools like Draw.io

This blueprint serves as the foundation for building scalable and maintainable software systems, following industry-standard methodologies and tools.
